In this report, I have provided a comprehensive analysis of the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to reduce CO2 emissions from the transportation sector, with a focus on the rise of EVs and their role in addressing this complex issue. This report will address the following research questions.
Research Questions:
1. How do greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2, vary across sectors and countries, and how has it impacted climate change?
2. What are the trends and major contributors to CO2 emissions within the transportation sector, considering various sub-sectors, vehicle types, and manufacturers?
3. Are electric vehicles a viable solution to reduce CO2 emissions, and what is the status of the EV charging infrastructure?
4. What is the status of net-zero carbon emissions target for various countries?

Methodology:
The methodology for this report is structured around the below process:
1. Data Collection: The analysis relied on three primary data sources to obtain relevant and comprehensive information:
• U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website (https://www.epa.gov/): This source provided data on CO2 emissions for the transportation sector.
• Our World in Data website (https://ourworldindata.org/): This source offered data related to CO2 emissions across various sectors and countries.
• International Energy Agency (IEA) website (https://www.iea.org/): This source supplied data related to electric vehicles (EVs) and their associated infrastructure.

2. Data Preparation: Tableau Prep Builder was utilized to clean, transform, and integrate the data collected from the sources.The data preparation process included the following steps:
• Connecting to each data source and importing the relevant datasets.
• Identifying and correcting data quality issues, such as missing or inconsistent values.
• Combining and transforming data as needed to create a unified and structured dataset for analysis.
• Linking tables from various data sources based on the 'year' column to facilitate comparative analysis over time.

3. Data Analysis: With the cleaned and prepared dataset, the analysis was conducted in a sequential manner, starting with a broad overview, and then narrowing the focus to specific areas of interest. The steps included:
• Analyzing CO2 emissions by sector and country to identify trends, outliers, and patterns.
• Assessing temperature anomalies and their correlation with CO2 emissions.
• Investigating the transportation sector, which contributes to 16.2% of emissions, and identifying the major sources of CO2 emissions within the sector.
• Examining the growth of electric vehicles and the expansion of EV infrastructure, as well as evaluating their potential impact on CO2 emissions reduction.
• Assessing countries’ progress towards net zero carbon emissions.
